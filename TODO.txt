First, we have to re-write all Carbon interfaces in a Cocoa (or Swift) way, and prepare 64 bits support. Externs using interfaces need to be extract from xmap_lib framework and build separatly.


* Calcs :
Nothing to do.

* Geogs :
GAlong, GFarthest, GFrom, GInclude, GInside, GLessThan, GMoreThan, GNearest and GOutside : build a Cocoa interface along with XMap Selector.
* Tools :
Alter, Contiguous, Create, Info, Justification, PrintArea, Redraw, Select, Shape, Split, SymbRotation and Zoom : build a Cocoa interface for param dialogs.

* UserExts :
Nothing to do.

* Vars :
Nothing to do.

* vDefs :
ScaleRef : build a Cocoa interface.

* XBox :
XBoxTransform : it could be nice to remove interfaces from transformation XMaps and build a new Cocoa interface for XBoxTransform

* XMaps :
Association, AssociationWithField, GeometryShift, Line2Surf, LineUp, MakePoly, MakeRect, MakeSquaring, Rotation, Scale, Shake, Simplify and Translation : rewrite in a Cocoa way or move interface to XBoxTransform.

Buffer, Selector : rewrite dialog to Cocoa.

JoinOnDir : donâ€™t work the proper way, need to fix it.

Print and PrintSetup : still using deprecated PMPrintSession APIs, need to be rewrite.

DBStructure, Paint, VarEditor, CloneDetector, DBDefVal, IGrid, DataFill, StringProcessing, TransType, ViewMgr, FExp, DataImport, DataJoin, ToolMenuConfig, Shortcuts, Prefs, NetClean, NetCleanOptions, DashPicker, IconPicker, PatternPicker, RasterImport, CalcEditor, TopoCheck : cocoa rewrite done in ClassesDev. Need to replace actual plugins for further versions.

JPGPublisher, PNGPublisher and TIFFPublisher : cocoa rewrite done in xmap_lib 


* XMLClasses :
Nothing to do.
