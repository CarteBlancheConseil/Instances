First, we have to re-write all Carbon interfaces in a Cocoa (or Swift) way, and prepare 64 bits support. Externs using interfaces need to be extract from xmap_lib framework and build separatly.


* Calcs :
Nothing to do.

* Geogs :
GAlong, GFarthest, GFrom, GInclude, GInside, GLessThan, GMoreThan, GNearest and GOutside : build a Cocoa interface along with XMap Selector.

* Tools :
Alter, Contiguous, Create, Info, Justification, PrintArea, Redraw, Select, Shape, Split, SymbRotation and Zoom : build a Cocoa interface for param dialogs.

* UserExts :
Nothing to do.

* Vars :
Nothing to do.

* vDefs :
ScaleRef : build a Cocoa interface.

* XBox :
Nothing to do.

* XMaps :
Selector : rewrite dialog to Cocoa.
JoinOnDir : donâ€™t work the proper way, need to fix it.

Done :
DBStructure, Paint, VarEditor, CloneDetector, DBDefVal, IGrid, DataFill, StringProcessing, TransType, ViewMgr, FExp, DataImport, DataJoin, ToolMenuConfig, Shortcuts, Prefs, NetClean, NetCleanOptions, DashPicker, IconPicker, PatternPicker, RasterImport, CalcEditor, TopoCheck, Association, AssociationWithField, GeometryShift, Line2Surf, LineUp, MakePoly, MakeRect, MakeSquaring, Rotation, Scale, Shake, Simplify, Translation, Buffer, Print, PrintSetup : cocoa rewrite done in ClassesDev. Need to replace actual plugins for further versions.
JPGPublisher, PNGPublisher and TIFFPublisher : cocoa rewrite done in xmap_lib 

* XMLClasses :
Nothing to do.
